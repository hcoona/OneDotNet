# Data

## wordlist.tsv.zip

Extracted from OALD mdx files.

The dictionary file is from https://pdawiki.com/forum/thread-38955-1-1.html (v13.2)

The Chinese meanings are coming from OALD9 official version, but the newly added
terms are machine translated.

Extracted by https://github.com/liuyug/mdict-utils to SQLite database, and then
exported to TSV file.

## lemmas.csv

Downloaded from https://www.wordfrequency.info/samples.asp.

Top 60,000 "lemmas" -> Top 5000 -> Download -> Open with Excel & Save as CSV.

It's possibly too small. Maybe I'd consider some unknown time table.
