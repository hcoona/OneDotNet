# Oxford dict extractor

This project is to extract information from [Oxford Learner's Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/).

The origin data is slightly modified to include Chinese translation.

The origin data is filtered according to [Oxford 3000 and 5000 wordlists](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/oxford3000-5000).

## Data Models

## Future
